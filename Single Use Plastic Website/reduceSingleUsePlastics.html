        <h1>What are Single Use Plastics?</h1>
        <!-- Brief introduction to single use plastics with button to learn more-->
        <p>Single use plastics are plastic products that are, as teir name implies, plastics that are meant to be disposed of after one
           use. They are mostly used for packaging, like plastic bottles, bags, wrappers, etc. They are used because as a culture, we priortize
           convience over long-term impacts. Unfortunatly, some of these long-term impacts we often overlook involve the enviroment and tend to pollute and damage
           it. However, we rely on the enviroment, so when we damage it with single use plastics, we are only causing future harm to ourselves.

        <h1>Single Use Plastic Pollution</h1>
        <br>
        <!--How single use plastics cause pollution, and why that pollution is a problem-->
        <p>When people are done with single use plastics, they dispose of them. The problem is, plastic doesn't break down quickly. It sticks around. When plastic is 
            recycled, it is remade into other plastic products. When it is throun in the trash, it breaks down in landfills. However, a lot of plastic, especially single-use 
            plastic isn't recycled or thrown away. It makes its way into the enviroment, especially the ocean. There, animals try to eat it. Birds eat shredded plastic, sea 
            turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, fish eat, and choke on, plastic, sets of plastic rings, like from soda, get stuck on the bills of birds, around animals 
            necks, and on the snouts of animals like dolphins. In sum, plastic gets into the enviroment, animals get a hold of it, and it kills them.
